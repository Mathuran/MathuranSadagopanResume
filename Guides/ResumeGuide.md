## Resume Guide
As most hiring managers and recruiters scan resumes (generally 11-20 seconds on average), RBP recommends keeping your resume to 2 pages for most professions and experience history.

For visual appeal, we suggest using one font style throughout your resume to give it a clean and professional look; I have adjusted accordingly. We recommend your font style is a sans serif font. Common choices include Calibri, Tahoma, Verdana, and Arial. Ensure your font size is not too small, or it may not be readable. You’ll want your resume to be easy-to-read at-a-glance.

For best readability, we recommend margins between .5” and 1”. I’ve made some adjustments to your margins. For additional insight, check out the Resume Essentials Webinar on the CRN.

## ATS guide
As many companies use an applicant tracking system (ATS) for all levels and functions, it’s best to keep your resume ATS compliant. 

Make sure to use:
- Round bullets (no arrows or special characters)
- Bold text where needed
- CAPS to provide emphasis
- most ATS read top-to-bottom, left-to-right, no matter what

Best practice is to omit the following as these have the potential to skew your content when scanned.
- italics
- underlining
- shading
- text boxes
- tables
- columns
