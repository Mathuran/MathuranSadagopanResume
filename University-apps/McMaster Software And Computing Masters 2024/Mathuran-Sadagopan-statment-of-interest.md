To Admission Committee,  
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am eager to return to McMaster University in order to pursue a Master's in Software and Computing. As a McMaster Alumni I admire McMaster's commitment to academic excellence and innovative research in software and computing. I look forward to working with esteemed professors like Dr.Swati Mishra and contribute to cutting edge research in the Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) labs. Continuing my education at an institution that has significantly shaped my journey delights me.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering at McMaster University in April 2021. My education included a capstone project where I developed a siren detection app using React Native, Python, and TensorFlow. This project not only honed my technical skills but also sparked my interest in applying software solutions to real-world problems.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since graduating, I have gained significant experience in software engineering. At Amazon, I delivered fraud prevention solutions for consumer payments and enhanced service availability through various systems and infrastructure. Currently, I am a Software Engineer at Rooster Financial, developing a financial intelligence platform that supports tracking traditional and non-traditional assets and leverages AI to create a natural text user experience for data analysis. This role has reinforced my belief in the power of interdisciplinary projects combining AI and financial technologies.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My primary research interest lies in the intersection of advanced computing technologies and science. I am particularly interested in exploring how to create explainable AI models that are required when AI is used in research. Collaborating with faculty members like Dr. Swati Mishra at the forefront of this field is an exciting prospect.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My long-term career goal is to lead innovative projects that leverage technology to solve pressing global challenges. In the short term my career goal is to launch Rooster Financial publicly. I am very interested in deeply integrating AI into the platform and wish to leverage this opportunity to learn advanced AI skill which I can then apply to my company. I am specifically interested in explainability because it is important in creating predictable and accurate models required for financial intelligence. Pursuing a Master's in Computing and Software at McMaster will equip me with the advanced knowledge and research skills necessary to achieve this goal.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McMaster University's state-of-the-art facilities and renowned faculty, particularly in the HCI, provide the perfect environment to deepen my expertise while contributing to meaningful advancements in computing and health sciences. Returning to McMaster also holds personal significance as it is where my passion for software development took off.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to return to McMaster University for my Master's in Computing and Software. I am confident that the program will provide me with the knowledge, skills, and research opportunities necessary to make significant contributions to the field of computing and health sciences.  
<br>
Sincerely,
