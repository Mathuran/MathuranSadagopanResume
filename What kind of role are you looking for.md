#### **Intro:** 
A dream of mine is to one day have my own startup and have my own company but before that I would really like to gather a lot of industry experience. 

#### Body
1. Start with your skills
2. you want the opportunity to continue developing and learning skills that will help make me be a famous programmer like John Carmack or Linus Torvalds or James Gosling.
3. For now I still want to be a developer so being able to continue building new feature and work on new projects rather than maintaining old ones would be great.
4. I've been reading a lot of software engineering books this year such as the Clean code book, Clean Architecture and studying for my AWS solution Architecture certification so being in role I can teach others those learning would be great.
#### Outro
I believe your company is growing and that I would be able to use my past experience to continue developing my programming and leadership skills
