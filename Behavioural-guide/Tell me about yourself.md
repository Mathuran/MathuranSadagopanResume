### explain your name 

> So I bet your wondering what the right was to say my name is? Have you ever read Harry Potter? My name rhymes with Slytherin. I've always enjoyed tinkering and building stuff. From young age I loved playing with Lego and then that turned into an interest in robotics in middle school and high school. Getting involved and competing in VEX and FRC robotics competition really inspired me to get into the Computer engineering / mechatronics field. I ended up going to McMaster University for computer engineering where I did a 4 year course and got 2 co-op jobs. My first was at Ellis Don a construction company where I did Frontend development creating a web application automating and stream lining construction workflows. The second coop was at Microsoft where I got to work on 2 teams. Windows Power toys and Microsoft Teams Android app. Then after graduating I got a full time role at Amazon where I worked in payment authentication and fraud prevention.
