# Sample Amazon Questions 

## Customer Obsession
This principle is about prioritizing customer needs and working tirelessly to earn and keep their trust​​.

1. "Describe a time when you went above and beyond to ensure a customer was satisfied. What was the situation and what actions did you take?"
   1. > **Situation**: When I learned that Mint Financial, a popular financial tracking tool, was shutting down and there were limited alternatives in Canada, I saw a gap in the market.
   2. > **Task**: My goal was to develop a Chrome Extension for Rooster Financial that could serve as a viable alternative, focusing on the essential features users missed from Mint.
   3. > **Action**: I conducted in-depth research by studying how friends and family utilized Mint to understand crucial features. Based on this, I prioritized and developed a Chrome extension to automate financial data tracking, reducing customer touchpoints significantly.
   4. > **Result**: Although the project is still in beta its clear thats its improving personal finance management for our users.

2. "Can you share an instance where you had to advocate for customer needs in the face of internal pushback? How did you handle it?"
   1. > Situation: This might be a hot take but fraud prevention at Amazon in general wasn't a huge priority because the added friction it brough to checkout and the customer experience wasn't worth the benifit.
   2. > Task: The goal of our team was to change that by introducing fraud prevention techniques that would boost purchase confidence
   3. > Action: Our team collaborated with our PM to develop and fine tune features that stoped fraud and either improved or not affect the customer exp. Some our solution were to use risk based based system to trigger challenge and more aggresivly challenge new customers.
   4. > Result: The project was a success and was able to significantly reduce bot attacks and fraud.


## Ownership
This principle assesses how candidates act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own responsibilities, with a long-term perspective​ (DataLemur)​.

1. "Tell me about a project where you took full ownership from start to finish. What were the challenges and results?"
2. "Recall a situation where you noticed a problem outside your direct responsibilities but took action to resolve it. What was the outcome?"
   1. > Situation: While working at Amazon, I conducted an audit and discovered that we were incurring an $80,000 annual cost for a log search tool that was no longer in use.
   2. > Task: My goal was to eliminate unnecessary costs and improve the efficiency of our resource allocation.
   3. > Action: I took the initiative to thoroughly review our service dependencies and usage. After confirming the tool's redundancy, I led the effort to decommission the service and reallocate resources more effectively.
   4. > Result: The action saved Amazon $80,000 per year, demonstrating significant cost efficiency and responsible resource management.


## Learn and Be Curious
This principle looks for candidates who have a thirst for knowledge and continually seek ways to improve and innovate​ (DataLemur)​.

1. "How do you stay up-to-date with industry trends and continuously learn in your field?"
   1. > I have many different avenues for this. I love learning on youtube and subscribe to many software engineering YT. talk about books and useing chatgpt
2. "Describe a time when your curiosity led to a significant learning opportunity or innovation within your team or project."
   1. > Situation: While I was working on a fraud prevention feature called NAC I noticed after launching the metrics looked off and were showing that nothing was happening.
   2. > Task: I wanted to find out what went wrong and if there was a bug in my code.
   3. > Action: As I couldn't find an issue with my code, I started working backwards from the metrics to uncover if there was an issue else where. I ended up finding a bug in the front-end that caused my issue but at the same time I also learned that area of code could also be used ot fix a larger problem the team has. which was blocking real time cvv launching globally.
   4. > Result: After presenting my bug fix to the team we were able to put together a nice solution to unblock real time cvv globally.

## Dive Deep
This principle is about operating at all levels, staying connected to details, and auditing frequently to ensure high standards are met​ (DataLemur)​.

1. "Provide an example of a complex problem you dove deep into to understand its root cause. What was the situation and how did you resolve it?"
   1. > Situation: After launching NAC I realized my feature wasn't working corretly and the metric almost made no sense
   2. > Task: I had to figure if there was a bug in my code or if it was external.
   3. > Action: I tore through my code and checked that my tests covered all possible edge cases. The next part was very tedious, which was checking all MCM that happened at the time to see if that inflluenced my feature. Lastly I started working backwards from the metrics and spent time with co-workers on the front-end to understand what was going on.
   4. > Result: After turing over all the stones we finally found the bug and made the fix
2. "Tell me about a time when you had to analyze a large amount of data or details to make a decision. How did you ensure the accuracy of your analysis?"
   1. > Talk about MCMs or peak event scalling calculations

## Are Right A Lot
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

1. Tell me about a time when you did not effectively manage your project, and something did not get completed on time?
