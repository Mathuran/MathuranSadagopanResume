		<tr>
			<td> Most Challenging </td>
			<td> Communication was a challenge in that role. This was a special kind of internship where the team consisted of only interns which meant event the project management was done by an intern. This became problematic because understanding project requirements and task breakdown was hard. Overcoming took a lot of back and forth with iterations on the design with the iOS developer and UX designer. </td>

				<ul> 
					<li>android development </li>
					<li>how to make engaging demo's</li>

		<tr>
			<td>Most Interesting</td>
			<td>Java android development is not fun compared to Kotlin. I wish I was able to use Jetpack compose instead</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Hardest Bug</td>
			<td>The meeting timer would use the same timer even after switch to a different meeting. This behavior wasn't defined in our design so after discussing the team we decided to make the timer be saved per meeting meaning switch in and out of meetings will let you continue where you left off.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Team Conflicts  </td>
			<td>I felt really confused about the mentor I got during the internship as he didn't have experience in android development. This made learning the project hard and tedious cause I had to find other people willing to help.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Achievement / Proud of </td>
			<td>
				<ul>
					<li>
						I was really proud of my final demo cause there were a lot engineers and high ranked managers there and I vividly remember 1 person just blurting out "beautifully done" after mine. I think he was just really satisfied by all the test cases I covered in my demo.
					</li>
					<li>The project was never released so I don't know what the business impact was</li>
				</ul>
