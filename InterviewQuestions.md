The lowest I would go is 90000 but I would only accept that kinda of offer if it was balanced out in some other manner.


### Why did you decide to become a software engineer / what interests you the most
I love the cycle of tackling hard problems. The process of building something, seeing it fail and trying out new ideas is one I find very addicting. I remember as a kid I always loved lego and as I got older I got interested in robotics, and then Computer Engineering. I my career right now is simply a continuation of that interest.

### Tell me about yourself?
explain your name >

I've always enjoyed tinkering and building stuff. From young age I loved playing with lego and then that turned into an 

### What are your strengths
I love learning.
I am good at bring the room together.

Tell me about a time when I solved a hard challenge. 

- Solved NAC not triggering verification in production due to code in APX not triggering with the new feature flag
  - This bug opened up a solution for solving a bigger problem called cvv double verify issue.
  - found the issue by diving into metrics and using that to find the code then learned how it worked to find the bug.
- Client throttling solution
- NAC. In order to stop fraud on new customers accounts I created a simple check to determine if they were a new customer / new inactive customer.
  - This solution checked if the customer had 0 available payment methods and challenged them.
  - Required no new information and was able to challenge inactive customers like those who have removed all their cards and added it back again
  - Improved customer trust and increased purchase by 10MM

### Why are you a great fit for our team at Kepler?

	I think I would be a great fit at Kepler because of my educational background in Computer Engineering and work experience in web development. Over the past years I’ve become very interested in the field of IOT and have even started working on my own IOT product that would automatically water my garden. Furthermore, it would stream the data to a web app where users can monitor their garden and control the watering system. From looking at my GitHub page I’ve worked on a variety of projects related to robotics, AR and hardware development. This show my desire to innovate as I don’t hold my idea back ideas. In conclusion, I believe I’d be a great fit for Kepler because of my interest in IOT and ability to innovate. 

Having had friends get co-ops here, I have heard many great things about the company and what the daily life is like, and so would be very excited to work here. Having studied computer engineering and worked at various other coops I think my skills align with the technologies and services that PagerDuty is developing. As shown is my past co-ops and projects I enjoy tackling new problems and developing new features and products. In the team I like to think of how I can push others to achieve more and challenge the way they think.

The following link has pictures and gifs of some of my past projects https://mathuran.github.io/mathuran_sadagopan/. I would like to highlight the IOT garden gnome project as it is the largest project I've worked on. My team started this project not with the goal of creating a product that anyone would really use but to learn how to an IOT product works as many automated gardening systems already exist. The idea behind this was to create a automated watering system that streams soil moisture and temperature online. Named after a garden gnome as they are creature that hide in the bushes and watch over your garden. To me this project demonstrated many aspects of working and creating a real product as we needed to use project management tools to spit the work and there was a front-end, back-end and hardware aspect to this project.

### Why are you interested in Agora?

From a young age I have always found myself fascinated in science and technology. Growing up playing with Lego Mindstorms kits, evolved into learning how to tinker with Arduinos and then becoming the president of my high school robotics club. For a long time, I have always wanted to be part of something big such as a start-up as I feel that a is where my work would have the most impact. At Agora, your mission is to make a construction as a service platform that allows customers to plan and setup construction supply chains online.  I would be thrilled to work on a project like this as I have worked on a similar construction project management platform in a previous co-op with Ellis-don. During which I worked as a front-end developer. I look forward to learning more about this opportunity, please feel free to reach out to me for any questions at mathuransada@gmail.com.
Why are u interested in Scale
Given that a growing number of companies are looking to be driven by data and analytics being able to make AI and ML easier to use is a must to tackle bigger problems. Growing up I have always been fascinated by sci-fi and AI’s taking over the word. My interest in tech started as playing with Lego Mindstorms kits as a kid, evolved into learning how to make python scripts and then becoming the president of my high school robotics club. I have always been looking forward to taking on bigger challenges whether that be figuring out how to organize events for my club or cracking a hard design problem. Having tried ML myself and heard stories of grad projects trying to implement AI one of the most annoying and arduous task of developing it is generating quality data that is labeled correctly. I believe your mission to turn this task into a simplified service will reshape how AI is developed and is a must for teams trying to scale their Ai models. Having read your company blog I think I resonate with many of the team’s core values and goals. I look forward to learning more about this opportunity, please feel free to reach out to me for any questions at mathuransada@gmail.com.

Anduril
Given that this company is working on a military defence and surveillance technology for building a border along Mexico and America, I think I won’t align with the core values of Andruil and their reason for developing military technology.

### Vise

Observe
Looking to join a high growth start up that will challenge me.  My twin recently worked on a project which automated creating cloud watch dashboards that use canaries for monitoring site reliability. The reaction from developers in how much they needed this surprised me which shows current SRE tools are lacking and that Observe is making a difference to make it cheaper and better.
